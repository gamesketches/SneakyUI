================================================
This game is an experiment in Deceptive User Interfaces.
I wanted to make a game with a UI that lies to the
player more and more and I think I've managed it with this title.

In the game you are an Ice Cube named Fred McFreezy. Your goal
is to get to the goal by going through different doors. You have
a thermometer, but there are also enviornmental clues that you can use
to confirm or deny what your thermometer is reading.
If you are on a heated door, your character
will begin melting. If you stand in front of a cold door, you'll gradually
get larger. If the screen goes green, it means you won. If it goes red, you've
lost.

That's about all there is to the game. The controls are just asdw, and Up
to go through a door. 

Enjoy.
